# Detecting_Fraud
An assignment in IE HST course on Fraud, Credit, and Risk Analytics

# Methodologies
- Imputation: Filling missing values based on filled values in other highly correlated variables to the missing value variable; a similar approach to K-nearest neighbors
- Oversampling: Replicating the fraud cases rows to get a better balance and help the algorithm predict fraud cases (increase recall)
- Modelling: Random Forest Classifier with Randomized Grid Search and 5 folds cross validation
